🎧 Spotify Clone
This is my first web development project, created using HTML & CSS. I tried to replicate the Spotify web player UI, focusing on design and responsiveness.

🚀 I know this project isn't perfect and may have errors, but it's a starting point in my web development journey. With continuous practice, I’ll improve and build more advanced projects.

✨ What I Learned
✅ Structuring a webpage with HTML
✅ Styling and layout using CSS 🎨
✅ Implementing icons & responsiveness 🖥️

This is just the beginning, and I’ll keep learning to become a better web developer. Any feedback is appreciated! 💡🔥
